Please describe your idea:

The idea is to create a team homepage for each team in the organization. This page would serve as a centralized hub, displaying key information about each team, including team members, services owned or used by the team, dependencies, documentation links, and relevant performance metrics.

What problem are you trying to solve?

Currently, there’s a lack of centralized visibility into each team’s resources, dependencies, and points of contact. This makes it difficult to manage dependencies across teams, slows down troubleshooting during incidents, complicates onboarding for new hires, and increases the time spent searching for relevant resources. Without a clear view of dependencies and ownership, collaboration and cross-team support are often hampered.

What is your proposal?

My proposal is to develop a team homepage for every team within the organization. Each page would provide:

	•	A team directory with members, roles, and contact information
	•	A list of services the team uses or manages, including their status and dependencies
	•	Links to essential documentation and other resources
	•	Key performance metrics or monitoring details for owned services
	•	Dependency maps to help visualize cross-team service relationships

This can be achieved by gathering data from existing systems and displaying it in a user-friendly and accessible format.

What is the benefit of your proposal & how will it help the bank?

The team homepage proposal would bring multiple benefits:

	•	Improved Onboarding: New hires can quickly get familiar with team structures, responsibilities, and resources.
	•	Enhanced Incident Management: Teams can quickly identify dependencies and escalate incidents to the right contacts, reducing downtime and enhancing service reliability.
	•	Efficient Collaboration: Having a clear view of dependencies and ownership enables seamless collaboration and reduces inter-team communication delays.
	•	Operational Oversight: Monitoring and dependency data allows teams to proactively manage service health, prioritize resources effectively, and plan for capacity.
	•	Knowledge Sharing: By centralizing resources and documentation, the bank fosters a culture of knowledge-sharing, leading to more efficient processes and reducing duplicated efforts.

This centralized approach helps the bank streamline operations, optimize resource management, and ultimately deliver more reliable services to customers.





Home

Purpose: Clear introduction to your team, its core responsibilities, and the products/services offered.
Additional Info: Consider including a mission statement or team objectives to give context about what your team aims to achieve within the organization. Adding links to other critical resources or systems used by the team could also be useful.
Blog

Purpose: Provides a repository of documentation for onboarding, production support, and potentially other processes.
Additional Ideas: Include categories for types of content, such as “Troubleshooting,” “Best Practices,” or “New Releases.” This can help users quickly locate relevant documentation.
Team

Purpose: Lists team members along with skills and roles.
Additional Ideas: Add an option to see team members by skill, making it easier to find specific expertise when needed. Including contact information or preferred collaboration methods (Slack, email, etc.) would also enhance accessibility.
Dependency

Purpose: Outlines dependencies on other teams, software, and systems.
Additional Ideas: Break down dependencies by category (e.g., “Internal Teams,” “External Software,” “Operational Dependencies”) for clarity. Additionally, you might add a section for critical dependency statuses or links to dependency health dashboards.
Roles-Access

Purpose: Lists roles within the team and instructions on requesting access.
Additional Ideas: Add a small FAQ for access requests, such as common questions about permissions or approval processes. Including approximate processing times for requests can also set clear expectations.
Achievement

Purpose: Highlights team achievements and milestones.
Additional Ideas: This section could be enhanced with visuals, like a timeline or icons, to make achievements stand out. Breaking down achievements by categories (e.g., “Project Milestones,” “Team Growth,” “Customer Impact”) could also make it more engaging.
